## Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1

## Open questions

## Possible implementations

For reference, you can look at the already existing ZUI components created on the `undocumented/new-design-system` branch (not ZUI components that exist on `main`, as they are not part of the new design system.)

## Git

The main git branch for the work on the new design system is `undocumented/new-design-system`. Unless otherwise instructed, do your work on a new branch branched off from this branch.

Name your branch `undocumented/zui-name`, ex: `undocumented/zui-button` for a branch where a button component is being made.
